# ðŸš€ Mistral.AI + FastAPI Integration  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description  
This project showcases the **integration of Mistral.AI with FastAPI**, developed as part of the **All-Girls Code Bootcamp â€“ Summer 2025**.  
The goal is to demonstrate how modern **LLM (Large Language Model) APIs** can be seamlessly combined with a **high-performance Python web framework** to build scalable, AI-powered applications.  

By leveraging **Mistral.AI** for natural language processing and **FastAPI** for backend services, the project highlights practical skills in **API integration, backend development, and AI application deployment**.

### 1. SDLC Stages Represented  
This project touches multiple stages of the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):**  

- **Understand:** We began by identifying the project goals â€“ integrating Mistral.AI with FastAPI â€“ and understanding how an LLM API could serve the applicationâ€™s needs.  
- **Design:** Planned the architecture, including endpoints, data flow, and how the backend communicates with Mistral.AI. We also decided on reusable modules and functions to keep the code clean.  
- **Build:** Implemented the project logic using Python and FastAPI, integrating the Mistral.AI API to handle requests.  
- **Test:** Validated correctness through unit tests and example runs, ensuring API requests returned expected responses.  
- **Release:** Deployed the application in a local or cloud environment to allow real users or testers to interact with it.  
- **Improve:** Planned for future enhancements such as adding automated tests, monitoring, CI/CD pipelines, and improving code modularity based on user feedback.  

âœ… **Summary:** By following these SDLC stages, the project maintains structure while allowing for iterative improvements and scalability.

### 2. Applied Design Principle  
I applied the **DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself)** principle by avoiding duplicate logic. Instead of rewriting similar code, I factored common functionality into reusable functions/classes.  

âœ… **Benefit:** Improves maintainability and reduces errors when making changes.

### 3. DevOps Practices for Improvement  
Adopting **DevOps practices** could improve reliability and scalability:  

- **Automation**: Using CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins) to automatically build and deploy code.  
- **Testing**: Testing the code after each change to avoid crashing and errors.  
- **Version Control**: Managing changes with Git for collaborative development.
